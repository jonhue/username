## Installation

Username works with Rails 5 onwards. You can add it to your `Gemfile` with:

```ruby
gem 'username'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install username

If you always want to be up to date fetch the latest from GitHub in your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'username', github: 'jonhue/username'
```

Now run the generator:

    $ rails g username

---

## Usage

You can add usernames to an ActiveRecord model:

```ruby
class User < ApplicationRecord
    has_username
end
```

**Important:** Make sure to add a `username` string column to the corresponding database table.

Username adds a validator to prevent the use of invalid usernames.

### Methods

```ruby
# If a username is valid for an ActiveRecord class
User.username_valid? 'test'

# If a username is available for an ActiveRecord model
User.first.username_available? 'test'
```

---

## Configuration

You can configure Username by passing a block to `configure`. This can be done in `config/initializers/username.rb`:

```ruby
Username.configure do |config|
    config.forbidden = []
end
```

* `forbidden` Array of forbidden usernames. Takes an array of strings. Defaults to `[]`.
* `minlength` Minimum length for usernames. Takes an integer. Defaults to `1`.
* `maxlength` Maximum length for usernames. Takes an integer. Defaults to `20`.
* `regex` Strings not matching this regular expression are invalid as usernames. Takes a regular expression. Defaults to `/\A[a-zA-Z0-9_\.]*\z/`.
* `global_uniqueness` Whether to validate usernames across all models or just the records model. Takes a boolean. Defaults to `true`.
